# manageiq-on-kubeadm
Run ManageIQ on Kubernetes

This is a rough project to run ManageIQ on generic Kubernetes

Deploy a Kubernetes cluster using "kubeadm"

Select a large worker node with 8 GB or more of RAM as the manageiq docker image is resource intensive.

Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running download the two manifest files and apply them.

These are first draft and need some additional work.
